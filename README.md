# cga_stats
This is a simple set of functions to calculate standard statistics within CityEngine's CGA programming language using string lists. While it is clear that using string lists and recursion to derive these statistics is a little strange, it does provide some useful applications within a CGA rule such as basing splits on string lists values (totals/sums) or finding various applications for calculating statistics from custom input data strings from GIS data. I have found a few applications for these functions and felt it might be worth sharing.
